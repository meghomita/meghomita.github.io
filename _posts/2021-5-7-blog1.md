title: Welcome to my Blog
excerpt: An introduction to the inner thoughts of my brain. Fair warning, It will be all about FOOD.

---

Ahoy there! This blog is going to be a brain-dump journal of sorts. It will mostly be food-related (think easy recipes, hot takes on food products, food stories and memories from my childhood). But at times, it might feature some rants, my internal monologues and other such stories. All opinions expressed in these posts are my own. Wherever possible, I will try to credit and/or cite the original source from where I got the idea from but since this is a diary and not a scientific paper article, it will not be cited as thoroughly as possible. Apologies for that. 

And with that, welcome guys, gals and my non-binary pals (as Kenji Alt-Lopez says) to Meghomitaâ€™s Blog!
