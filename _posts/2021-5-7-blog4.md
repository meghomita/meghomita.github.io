## Dear Friends,

Below you will find the reading schedule for Week 1 of History Together, an online read-along focusing on works that illuminate American history through the lens of race. We will begin with [*Never Caught: The Washingtons' Relentless Pursuit of Their Runaway Slave, Ona Judge*](http://ericaarmstrongdunbar.com/nevercaught-ericaarmstrongdunbar) by Erica Armstrong Dunbar. 

Each day, I will share a few thoughts from that day's chapter. You can find my observations, as well as the ideas you all have shared using #HistoryTogether, collected here. I hope our daily reading is a time to reflect, individually and as a group, and to develop a community in the process.

I also hope you will join me on the evening of Wednesday, July 8 for a virtual get together to meet and talk to each other about the book.

Thank you so much for starting this journey with me!

## Be well,
## Carrington

## Week One Reading Schedule

**Monday, June 21.** Author's Note, Foreward & Chapter One: Betty's Daughter.

In this opening, I am struck by Dunbar's footnote on the use of enslavement vs. slave, a topic that has been much discussed in the last few weeks. Reading this chapter, it is easy to forget how little historical evidence she has to go on.

"Her distinctive name set her apart from her siblings and from the majority of the other bondmen and bondwomen who toiled with her in Virginia." For more on the power of names for black women, see Martha Jones in [this week's New York Times.](http://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/style/self-care/sojourner-truth-harriet-tubman-slavery-names.html)

**Tuesday, June 22.** Chapter Two: New York-Bound.

Having just read Alexis Coe's *You Never Forget Your First*, I am intrigued by this version of Martha. 

It remains a sad truth that a biography of an enslaved woman includes many pages about her owner, by necessity.

**Wednesday, June 23.** Chapter Three: New York in Black and White.

<p align="center">

</p>

I was particularly struck at this early example of white privilege and the police.

</p>

I'd love to know your reactions to this description of New York - the same New York described in the musical *Hamilton.*<br>

Dunbar refers to Judge as a "changed woman," but I wonder how comfortable we are with this kind of inference? Is it a necessary evil when writing about those who did not leave diaries?

**Thursday, June 24.** Chapter Four: The Move to Philadelphia.

Seriously, let me know. I'm torn on this one. Is it just a use of available sources? Or does it add something to our understanding of Ona's life?

You can learn about the portrait long presumed to be Hercules [here.](http://www.inquirer.com/food/craig-laban/george-washington-slave-chef-cook-hercules-gilbert-stuart-painting-wrong-20190301.html)


**Friday, June 25.** Chapter Five: The Blacks in the Family.

As you can see, having a slaveowning President was always controversial. 

The title of this chapter really says it all. It is the heart of the argument, the hypocrisy (double think?) that allows Washington to get by as a slavery-neutral President. See Katie's comment below (and respond!!)

I was also interested in Dunbar's assertion that Hercules employed "theatrics" to trick the Washingtons. Others have claimed he was simply offended.

**Saturday, June 26.** Chapter Six: Life in Philadelphia.

<p align="center">

Today's discussion of Yellow Fever was painful to read, especially in light of [this op-ed](http://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/black-people-arent-naturally-vulnerable-to-covid-19-thats-junk-race-science/2020/06/25/d04a5f98-b5d2-11ea-a8da-693df3d7674a_story.html) from this week. Just as today, Black Americans were asked to be "essential workers" during a pandemic, justified by a racist belief in their immunity from disease. 

A new newsletter will go out tomorrow. Keep your eyes out! 

**Sunday, June 27.** Chapter Seven: The Wedding.

What a beautiful halfway point. Dunbar connects the evidence we do have to create a convincing argument as to the reason's behind Ona's choice. While we cannot know her feelings, this chapter is quite a compelling case. You might be interested to know that Thomas Law's two biracial children, unlike Ona, were accepted in American society and [attended Harvard and Yale,](http://www.google.com/books/edition/_/3x0-DwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0) respectively. 

It has been such a pleaure reading with you this week. Onward!
