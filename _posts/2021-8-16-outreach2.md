**Volunteer at Science and Policy Exchange, Montreal, Canada**

I joined Science and Policy Exchange, a student-led non-profit organization dedicated to science policy, as a volunteer in July 2021. In my role, I am involved with different projects within the organization. Currently, I am working with a team of fellow members to organize, develop and promote a public forum workshop titled "EDI in Action: Best Practices and Future Directions" to be held in September 2021. 


**EDI Committee Graduate Student Member at Earth & Planetary Sciences (EPS), McGill University**

I joined the Equity, Diversity, Inclusion (EDI) Committee of my department in June 2020. Since then, I have been working with my fellow committee members to develop policies, resources and events to ensure a more diverse, inclusive and equitable environment in our department. We initiated student-run events like "Culture Chats" where our international students shared their home country's culture and their academic journey thus far. I worked with the Committee to develop and launch the departmental blog, Geoblog to showcase the diversity of our department. Currently, I am working with the committee members to develop an EDI resouce webapge for the department. 

I authored an article on _Culture Chats_ for the Office of Science Education's blog that can be found _[here](https://www.mcgill.ca/ose/channels/news/divided-geography-yet-united-same-love-rocks-327667)_.

**Unlearning Racism in Geosciences (URGE) EPS Pod Task Force Member**

_[URGE](https://urgeoscience.org/)_ is an NSF-Funded international discussion group where over a 16-week session, geoscientists from various Universities discussed, read, and created actionable deliverables to address issues of racism and lack of diversity in the Geosciences. I was a member of the McGill Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences Pod. Over the 16 weeks we learned about various topics including history of racism, environmental racism and justice, equity in admissions, racial trauma to name a few. Our further plans include integrating the deliverables developed during URGE to departmental level policy. In that regard, I authored the "Montreal Survival Guide", a resource guide with useful tips and tricks for surviving and finding community in the city of Montreal. This document was shared with the new members as part of the new, more supportive and inclusive onboarding process in our department. Currently, I am working on developing a crisis resouces guide to be shared with our department members that will provide them with a toolkit to be used during crisis situations.
