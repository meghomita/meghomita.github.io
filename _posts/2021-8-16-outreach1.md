 1. **Temblor Earthquake News Extern**
 
   I joined the externship at _[Temblor Earthquake News](https://temblor.net/about-temblor/)_ in June 2021. As one of the externs, I write news release articles for recently   published papers or recent geohazard events. Some of my tasks include interviewing primary and secondary sources for the article, drafting the outline for the news release and working with the expert editors of Temblor before publishing and sharing it across social media and on the Temblor News websites.

My authored articles for Temblor can be found _[here](https://temblor.net/discoveries/scientists-unravel-indias-2021-chamoli-disaster-12972/)_. 
 
 
 2. **Virtual Fossils Tour around downtown Montreal, Canada**
 
  This field trip guide was developed with support from the Redpath Museum of Natural History, Canada and the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, McGill University, Canada. This virtual field trip guide takes the viewers through seven locations within the downtown area of Montreal and highlights the fossils embedded within the building stones of some historic buildings in Montreal. This trip was aimed for the general audience and was launched during McGill's Homecoming Weekend 2020. The interactive ArcGIS Story Maps platform is supported on all devices, making this whole field guide more accessible. The guide is available in French and English. Media coverage for this event can be found _[here](http://www.mcgilltribune.com/sci-tech/taking-a-virtual-tour-of-mcgills-stones-and-fossils-10142020/)_ and _[here](https://www.mcgill.ca/ose/channels/news/storytelling-points-compass-how-story-maps-can-bring-life-conference-and-course-learning-experiences-328243)_.

 3. **Metro @ Monteregie virtual geological field trip guide: Building stones of Montreal, Canada**

  This project was developed in collaboration with the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, McGill University, Canada and the Redpath Museum of Natural History, Canada. This project consists of a set of virtual field trip guides, hosted on Google Earth platform. I was responsible for developing the *Building Stones of Montreal, Canada guide*, available in French and English. This trip is tuned towards geoscience enthusiasts at undergrad and/or CEGEP/High School level. The eleven locations of this trip spotlights different rock types used to construct the buildings, the quarries that supplied these rocks and how these stones shaped the architecture of this city. Each location features a short explanatory text, aided with videos of geoscientists explaining the geology of the building stones. I was responsible for developing the content of this field trip with media contribution from McGill's media team. This trip is supported on all devices, making this field guide more accessible. Other trips included in this project are: Kaleidoscope of research on Mont Saint Hilaire, Canada and Geology of Mont Royal. A blog post introducing this project can be found _[here](https://www.winstepforward.org/blog/2020/10/field-trips-time-covid-19/)_.
