**Overview** <br>
I am an earth science researcher with specialization in structural geology and geological mapping. Over the years, I have led and developed several projects from initial ideation, dataset integration and analysis to final completion, accompanied by peer-reviewed publications and technical reports. I am interested in roles that allow me to bring my extensive multi-disciplinary research expertise to applied geoscience projects.<br>
