**About Me** (pronouns: she/they) <br>
![an image alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/das_meghomita.jpg#left) 
I completed my PhD thesis in the Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences, at McGill University. My thesis explored the structural heterogeneity within the Franciscan Subduction Complex in California in order to characterize the behaviors of rocks at the deep end of the subduction interface. I worked at Angel Island, California to unravel the rock signatures and mechanics of deep tremor and slow slip in subduction zones. I am available to collaborate on potential earthquake geology centered projects.<br>

I am interested in science communication and science policy. I volunteered with the Science and Policy Exchange, a student-led not profit organization that works with students and leaders across industry, academia, and government to champion for science policy. I am a graduate student member of my department's Equity-Diversity-Inclusion Committee. As a minority in geosciences, I am passionate about decolonizing geosciences and increasing representation from historically marginalized communities in geosciences and STEM. I am a science writing fellow for Temblor Earthquake News and have previously created content for the Redpath Museum of Natural History, Montreal. For more details, check out the Outreach page. <br>

Before I started my PhD, I got my BSc in Geology from St Xavierâ€™s College, Mumbai in 2016 and my MSc in Applied Geology and PG Diploma in Earth Sciences from Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay in 2018-2019. I was a SN Bose Scholar 2017 where I got the opportunity to work with Dr Gautam Mitra at the University of Rochester, New York-USA. Besides looking at rocks and pondering DEI issues in Geosciences, I also like to read, crochet, travel, bake and geek out on food history!<br>
