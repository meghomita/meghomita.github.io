**About Me** [&#128266;](http://devanthakkar.com/)<br>
I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences, at McGill University. I study how earthquakes form and the way they transfer energy to the surface by examining the rock record of ancient earthquakes. I am working at Angel Island, California to unravel the rock signatures of deep tremor and slow slip in subduction zones. Using a combination of field mapping and analytical techniques like optical and electron microscopy, I plan to uncover the mechanisms behind deep tremor. <br>
I am also interested in outreach and science communication. I volunteer with the Redpath Museum of Natural History in Montreal in developing virtual field trips for the general public. As a minority in geosciences, I am passionate about decolonizing geosciences and increasing representation from historically marginalized communities in geoscience. I am currently working with the Equity-Diversity-Inclusivity (EDI) Committee in my department to develop an EDI resource website. <br>
Before I started my PhD, I got my BSc in Geology from St Xavierâ€™s College, Mumbai in 2016 and my MSc in Applied Geology and PG Diploma in Earth Sciences from Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay in 2018-2019. I was a SN Bose Scholar 2017 where I got the opportunity to work with Dr Gautam Mitra at the University of Rochester, New York-USA. <br>
