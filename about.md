**About Me** (pronouns: she/they) <br>

I completed my PhD thesis in the Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences, at McGill University. _[My thesis](https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zg64ts442)_ explored the structural heterogeneity within the Franciscan Subduction Complex in Angel Island, California in order to characterize the behaviors of rocks responsible for producing slow slip and tremor at the deep end of the subduction interface. Recently, I have transitioned to the mineral exploration industry wherein I bring my structural geology expertise to understanding geometry of mineral deposits in tectonically complex terranes. With my multi-disciplinary expertise, I am open to consultancy-based roles within the domains of structural geology, rock mechanics and seismic hazard risk assessments. <br>

Besides being a geoscientist, I am also interested in science communication and science policy-based projects. I have volunteered with the Science and Policy Exchange, a student-led not profit organization that works with students and leaders across industry, academia, and government to champion for science policy within the Canadian political landscape. I have dabbled in multiple science communication projects at McGill University on the themes of public outreach of geosciences, decolonozing and diversifying STEM, documeting relevance of science communication and implementing various initiatives tailored towards fieldwork safety protocols and increasing belonging in STEM. As a science writer for Temblor Earthquake News, I have covered several stories on the themes of geohazards and earthquakes. At present, I am available to collaborate on potential science communication and geoscience outreach based projects. <br>

Before I started my PhD, I got my BSc in Geology from St Xavier’s College, Mumbai in 2016 and my MSc in Applied Geology and PG Diploma in Earth Sciences from Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay in 2018-2019. I was a SN Bose Scholar 2017 where I got the opportunity to work with Dr Gautam Mitra at the University of Rochester, New York-USA. Besides looking at rocks and pondering DEI issues in Geosciences, I also like to read, crochet, travel, bake and geek out on food history!<br>
