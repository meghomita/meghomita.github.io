**About Me** (pronouns: she/they) <br>
![an image alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Meghomita.jpg#left) 
I am a final year PhD candidate in the Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences, at McGill University. I study how earthquakes form and the way they transfer energy to the surface by examining the rock record of ancient earthquakes. I am working at Angel Island, California to unravel the rock signatures and mechanics of deep tremor and slow slip in subduction zones. I am currently looking for postdoctoral and science communication opportunities in the upcoming year.<br>

I am interested in science communication and science policy. I volunteer with the Science and Policy Exchange, a student-led not profit organization that works with students and leaders across industry, academia, and government to champion for science policy. I am a graduate student member of my department's Equity-Diversity-Inclusion Committee. As a minority in geosciences, I am passionate about decolonizing geosciences and increasing representation from historically marginalized communities in geosciences and STEM. I am a science writing fellow for Temblor Earthquake News and have previously created content for the Redpath Museum of Natural History, Montreal. For more details, check out the Outreach page. <br>

Before I started my PhD, I got my BSc in Geology from St Xavierâ€™s College, Mumbai in 2016 and my MSc in Applied Geology and PG Diploma in Earth Sciences from Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay in 2018-2019. I was a SN Bose Scholar 2017 where I got the opportunity to work with Dr Gautam Mitra at the University of Rochester, New York-USA. Besides looking at rocks and pondering DEI issues in Geosciences, I also like to read, crochet, travel, bake and geek out on food history!<br>
