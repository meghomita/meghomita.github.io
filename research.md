I worked on a variety of projects in the field of Structural Geology during my Masters and summer internships. Currently, I am in Prof Christie Rowe's [Field Rheology Research group](https://www.eps.mcgill.ca/~crowe/) . Here is a brief description of my PhD research project and the other projects that I had the pleasure of working on. 


**Deep Subduction Zone Dynamics**
 
 Large earthquakes can strike at any time. They cause damage to human lives, properties and trigger other catastrophic events like tsunamis. Development of early-alert systems requires understanding of processes that trigger earthquakes, which provides the time needed to mitigate damages and save lives.
Subduction zones, where one tectonic plate dives under the other, host large earthquakes. About 20 years ago, scientists detected faint tremors coming from deep parts of subduction zones. In Cascadia, Canadian researchers described this signal as deep tremor and slip. The tremors were accompanied by the shift of the land surface toward the
ocean. These signals appear to be revealing deep, slow, nearly silent earthquakes which transfer stress up into the locked zone, where large earthquakes originate. I propose to examine rocks which come from this deep zone, which have been brought to the surface by tectonic uplift and erosion, to investigate the mechanisms of slow, silent
earthquakes.
Ancient subduction zone rocks are found in a few places at the Earthâ€™s surface and can reveal the mechanisms of locking and slip that produce slow, silent earthquakes. Through field studies and microstructural analyses, I will determine which processes cause these events and investigate the mechanisms and estimate the amount of stress
transfer in the subduction zone. These estimates can be used to constrain tectonic loading (stress accumulation) which controls the earthquake magnitude (size of the earthquake) and recurrence (time till the next large earthquake).

**Lateral Variation in the Katrol Hill Fault, Bhuj, near Gujarat, western India.**

  This was my Master's Home project, supervised by Prof Malay Mukul at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. The Kutch region of Gujarat in western India was the epicentre of the 2001 Mw 7.7 Bhuj Earthquake. Kutch boasts of several fault systems that served as epicenters for historic earthquakes and displacement along these faults helped shape the current landscape of the region. One of these fault systems is called the Katrol Hill Fault (KHF), bordered by the Katrol Hill Range. My project involved mapping the KHF fault segments to determine the variation in geometry of the thrust sheet. Displacement along this fault generated a fault propagation fold (FPF) with a slight variation in orientation due to fault rotation. The fault zone rocks, mostly sandstones with variable quantities of quartz and mica grains, experienced shallow crustal deformation. We determined the strain experienced by these rocks using the Normalized Fry method along a transport parallel transect. Tha hanging wall recorded higher strain than the footwall rocks. The microstructures developed in these rocks showed evidences of brittle fracturing and cataclastic flow, suggesting deformation in an elastico-frictional regime.

**Microstructural investigation of the Towanda Fault Zone in the Appalachian Plateau, Pennsylvania, USA.**
  
  As part of my summer internship at University of Rochester, New York under the supervision of Prof Gautam Mitra, I did a minor project on the fault zone rocks of the Towanda Fault Zone. The project started with the overview of the deformation stages along the Appalachian fold thrust belt. I focused on understanding the deformation phases at the Towanda Fault Zone, in northeastern Pennsylvania. Using field and microstructural observations, we deduced 3-4 phases of deformation as preserved by structural fabrics and overprinting relationships between the fabrics. In order to identify minor cryptic fault/fracture planes, we mapped and conducted fracture density counting along a horizontal transect within the Towanda fault zone. Our study revealed that several cryptic fracture planes is present once we mapped the microstructures to the outcrop scale observations. This project was supported by the S.N. Bose Scholars Program (2017) that allows select Indian students to pursue a funded internship project at a research institution in United States as part of India-United States of America collaboration efforts.

**Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) Dating : Sample processing & analysis of Quaternary sediments from the western Indian basin of Gujarat**

  As part of my undergraduate summer internship at the Institute of Seismological Research (ISR)-Gandhinagar (India), I did a project on using luminescence dating methods to determine the basinal uplift rate for the seismically active terrain of Gujarat in western India. I was mentored by Dr M.R. Kumar and Dr. Siddharth Prizomvala for this project. OSL dating provides reliable ages, especially for the age range where the radiocarbon dating methods are not feasible. I got an overview of the entire process of OSL dating from sample collection to data processing and analysis. I worked on quaternary sediments and terrace deposits accumulated along river basins that are cross-cut by active faults to determine uplift rates. In combination with sedimentological characteristics of the samples, I reconstructed the paleo-depositional and paleo-seismological history of one of the river basins in Gujarat. This project added on to the growing data base of paleoseismological uplift rates of the tectonically active Gujarat basin of India.
