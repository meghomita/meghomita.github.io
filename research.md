I worked on a variety of projects in the field of Structural Geology during my Masters and summer internships. Currently, I am in Prof Christie Rowe's Field Rheology Lab group (insert link here). Here is a brief description of my PhD research project and the other projects that I had the pleasure of working on. 


##**Deep Subduction Zone Dynamics**

  Large earthquakes can strike at any time. They cause damage to human lives, properties and trigger other catastrophic events like tsunamis. Development of early-alert systems requires understanding of processes that trigger earthquakes, which provides the time needed to mitigate damages and save lives.

  Subduction zones, where one tectonic plate dives under the other, host large earthquakes. About 20 years ago, scientists detected faint tremors coming from deep parts of subduction zones. In Cascadia, Canadian researchers described this signal as deep tremor and slip. The tremors were accompanied by the shift of the land surface toward the
ocean. These signals appear to be revealing deep, slow, nearly silent earthquakes which transfer stress up into the locked zone, where large earthquakes originate. I propose to examine rocks which come from this deep zone, which have been brought to the surface by tectonic uplift and erosion, to investigate the mechanisms of slow, silent
earthquakes.

  Ancient subduction zone rocks are found in a few places at the Earthâ€™s surface and can reveal the mechanisms of locking and slip that produce slow, silent earthquakes. Through field studies and microstructural analyses, I will determine which processes cause these events and investigate the mechanisms and estimate the amount of stress
transfer in the subduction zone. These estimates can be used to constrain tectonic loading (stress accumulation) which controls the earthquake magnitude (size of the earthquake) and recurrence (time till the next large earthquake).
